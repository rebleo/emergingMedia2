1.1.19 We walked up to the stage. It was so noisy in the room. Over half the seats were empty.

1.2.19 He was leaning against a wall and his eyes were closing and rolling. His hair was longer. I asked him if he drank and did drugs and he said all of them.

1.4.19 We were sitting on a brownstone stoop, laughing. A woman walked out of the house and stood in front of us. She pulled up the bottoms of her tight black pants to show us her thin muscled calves.

1.5.19 I was on a journey with my parents. They were trying to save me.

1.8.19 A thin black snake was split lengthwise and both pieces were attached to my toes.

1.9.19 There were big chunks of potatoes in a pan. My lover was singing about soup.

1.11.19 The manager said he was going to jump off the ledge like an old man and he tumbled down in a pile of limbs.

1.12.19 I saw myself in the mirror without makeup and a red line under my left eye. I thought I looked old.
1.14.19 I took a picture of a dirty corner where the grass had turned to icy mud. I took pictures of the parking signs.
